# CSCI 366: Systems

_3 Credits. (3 Lec) S_

PREREQUISITE: CSCI 112 and CSCI 232. Introduces students to fundamental concepts in computer systems, including software
environments and development tools, computer architecture and organization, concurrency, information management, network
communications, and operating systems based on cloud computing

## Overview

CS366 is designed to give you a broad overview of computing. We are going to look at computing from “bottom to top”,
where we break the class into three different sections:

* The CPU (and Assembly) – We will first talk about transistors and how binary computing works a the lowest level. We
  will then go over how the CPU actually works, using a simple 8 bit CPU to explain things. Finally we will look at
  assembly, both Little Man Computer assembly as well as MIPS assembly.
* C Programming – With a deeper understanding of how the CPU actually works, we will revisit C programming, with a focus
  on features that are “close to the metal” like pointers and bit masks. We will look at how a compiler takes C-like
  features and produces the appropriate assembly instructions
* High Level Programming – With C behind us, we will next move up to higher level concepts like concurrency, networking
  and virtual machines, mainly focused on Java

## Logistics

### Lectures

Lectures are at 2:10PM, MWF in Romney 8.

Rather than a midterm or final, the class will have quizzes every other Friday, beginning the third
week. The quizzes will be available online via D2L, and we will not have in-person classes on those days.

All lectures will be live-streamed via YouTube.

There is an active Discord for the server, a link to join can be found on the content tab in D2L.

### Office Hours

Office hours are MWF, 4:10-5PM in my office, 364 Barnard, or in the 347 Barnard conference room.

### Course Grading

Course grading will be broken down as follows:

* Project - 60%
* Quizzes - 40%

The project is a major focus of the class, and will be done individually and graded mainly via
automated tests:

* 90% - The automated test suite
* 10% - Code quality, determined by manual inspection

### Book

There is no required book for this course.

I do recommend you purchase "But How Do It Know", a great introductory book on how computers work:
